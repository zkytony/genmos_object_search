middleware-independent SLOOP Object Search package.


There are two packages:

- sloop: provides spatial language observation model
- sloop\_object\_search: combines SLOOP with multi-object search.


If you are using ROS, you should just build the ROS package.

If not using ROS, you can install this package by
```
pip install -e .
```
