# An improvement over GridMap.
# Not changing GridMap directly because much code depends on it
# (especially for simulation)
#
# The biggest differences GridMap2 has over GridMap are:
#
# - Grid coordinates don't have to be non-negative.
# - There is no width and length as an input parameter to build a GridMap2;
#   they are inferred based on the given grids.
# - GridMap2 does not handle conversion between world coordinates and
#   grid map coordinates. That is handled by SearchRegion, which does
#   the conversion differently from GridMap, in a simpler and cleaner way.
#
# GridMap2 will emphasize the idea that a grid map is a collection
# of grids. Indeed, these grids live on a lattice, but the construction
# of a GridMap2 does not require specifying every grid on the lattice.
# Unspecified grids will have "unknown" occupancy.
#
# Note that because the grids live on a lattice, the grid coordinates
# are integers, and there will always be a (0,0) grid. This forms the
# coordinate system of the 2D object search agent.
#
# One benefit of not requiring non-negative coordinates is that the
# grid map can be extended in any direction, while keeping the coordinates
# of known grid cells unchanged.
