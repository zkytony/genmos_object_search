tests the SLOOP POMDP model. These tests are designated for spatial
language-enabled object search, which are performed in 2D open street maps.

For tests of MOS (possibly with SLOOP as well) in other
simulators or environments, see tests in ../simulations

The tests here are meant to make sure the result of
first_base (see github release) doesn't break.
