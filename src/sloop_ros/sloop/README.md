This is an extraction (with modifications) of [the original sloop package](https://github.com/h2r/sloop)
for the paper
[Spatial Language Understanding for Object Search in Partially Observed City-scale Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02705)
(RO-MAN 2021).
It gets the idea of SLOOP, while making it more concise and extensible for use on robots.
